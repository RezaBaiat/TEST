# ReactNative Boilerplate
This boilerplate is designed with mindset of performance in simplicity and tries to simplify routine tools . we try to wrap things up and staticify the whole project in a way that in order to change logics we have to pay visit to only a few files

## Tools
tools used in this project are based on nodepack (https://github.com/pixelsandcode/nodepack)

What else we are using
-
- `react-native-navigation v2`:(https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) as router
- `react-native-elements` (https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements) as UI Pack
- `react-native-vector-icons` (https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) as icons feed
- `react-timer-mixin` (https://github.com/reactjs/react-timer-mixin) as default timer pattern
- `redux` (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) as our state container
- `react-native-dev-kit` (https://github.com/pixelsandcode/reactnative-dev-kit) as the pixelandcode's react development kit repo

## How to use

Android's manifest & gradle are up to date and ready to use and the project can be run on android with 

`yarn android` , `yarn android:prod`

or on ios with

`yarn ios` , `yarn ios:prod`

there are some more scipts worth mentioning:

`installNoDev` installs app without need to Nodejs server

`upgradeLatest` allows interactive libraries update

`doc` automated documentation generation



### App
this boilerplate tries to implement classes and methods as most static as possible . 
it also tries to take the most advantages of wrapping any thing that is possible to do so ,
resulting in ease of future changes. lets explore the app content a bit:
 
- project structure :

   `/src` all sources except index.js go inside this folder \
   `/assets` container folder of our fonts and images \
   `/misc` templates of docco's documentary \
   `/docs` generated by docco , containing the app's generated docs \
   `/test` all our tests go inside this folder \
   `/src/activities` contains all screens of the app \
   `/src/configs` contains all app's staging & production configurations
   `/src/models` the containers of APIs models layer \
   `/src/network` responsible folder for all network & API callbacks \
   `/src/redux` contains and all global state needs \
   `/src/ui` the container of all UI components wrapper , also containing the Views which are made by components \
   `/src/utils` the names tells it all ! :)
   
- index.js :

by default we only include pre initializers, screen registrations and workarounds inside this file, as this it is the first file will be compiled

registering screens are very easy! all you have to do is this:

`Navigation.registerComponentWithRedux('App', () => require('./src/App').default,Provider,store);`

and later navigate to it by :

`AppNavigator.navigateTo('App')`

seriously piece of cake is an insult !

- AppNavigator.js :

if you want to navigate , you want to listen to navigation events, you want to go back , you want to change the stack root , this beautiful lady is who you will want to visit! it smartly simplifies the simplified react-native-navigation even more !

- BuildConfig.js :

there are 2 files in the root starting with `.env` responsible for staging or production environments . 
by default running `yarn android` will enable staging and `yarn android:prod` will run in production mode.
then info inside the corresponding `.env` file will be coppied into `BuildConfig.js` file , allowing App Configs to be served statically. info inside these files are also accessible from `gradle`

- Logger.js :

logging is also simplified using this class . so you have to only call :

`Logger.info('weather...could be better!')`  or  `Logger.error('my stomach hurts !')` or `Logger.silly('tonight is sunny!')`

- Store.js :

our Redux reducer(s) and its middlewares go here and we create the store inside it . the default root reducer is named `rootReducer`

- Actions.js :

Redux is an implementation of Observer pattern , but the world seems to go crazy when try to introduce it! 

let us simplify it for you:

```javascript
import store from '../Store';

/**
* this is how we can get our rootReducer's state (statically)
*/
 static getRootState() : InitialState{
     return store.getState().rootReducer;
 }
 
 /**
 * and this is how we dispatch an action (statically)
*/
static setNetworkState(isConnected : boolean) {
    store.dispatch({
      type: ACTION_NETWORK_STATE_CHANGE,
      payload: isConnected,
    });
  }

  /**
  * in addition to the component state, these props are also available statically! 
*/
  static isNetworkAvailable() : boolean {
    return this.getRootState().isNetworkAvailable;
  }
 
```

that would be all!

- root.js

and finally this is our reducer responsible for handling actions dispatched from Actions.js

- colors.js , drawables.js , strings.js & R.js

R is shortened word for Resources (Hello Android) , colors.js , drawables.js and strings.js are holders of their names! \
yes we obviously keep our resources static too , so you can simply call them by:

`<Text>{R.strings.holla}<Text/>`
